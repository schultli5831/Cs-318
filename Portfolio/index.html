<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I’m Lydia Schultz! I am attending the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire and graduating this spring for Graphic Communications. My interests include art, staying active, social events, going to coffee shops and watching sports. I am from Onalaska, WI and attended all schooling prior there. I have three brothers and two dogs, In which all live in La Crosse, WI. I have spent so much time trying to figure out what I want to do in the future, and I couldn’t be happier with the major I have chosen. Throughout high school, I have won three years of consecutive Spanish art competitions, my art has been in the newspaper, and I earned college credit for my AP art submission. Graphic design and art are my passions along with being social and communicating. I know that this is exactly what I was meant to do and I’m very excited to see where my creativity and this major take me! </p>
