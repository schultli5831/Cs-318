            <h3>Völuspá</h3>
            <h4>Stanzas 1-5</h4>
            <p>Hearing I ask | from the holy races,
            From Heimdall's sons, | both high and low;
            Thou wilt, Valfather, | that well I relate
            Old tales I remember | of men long ago.</p>
            <p>I remember yet | the giants of yore,
            Who gave me bread | in the days gone by;
            Nine worlds I knew, | the nine in the tree
            With mighty roots | beneath the mold.</p>
            <p>Of old was the age | when Ymir lived;
            Sea nor cool waves | nor sand there were;
            Earth had not been, | nor heaven above,
            But a yawning gap, | and grass nowhere.</p>
            <p>Then Bur's sons lifted | the level land,
            Mithgarth the mighty | there they made;
            The sun from the south | warmed the stones of earth,
            And green was the ground | with growing leeks.</p>
            <p>The sun, the sister | of the moon, from the south
            Her right hand cast | over heaven's rim;
            No knowledge she had | where her home should be,
            The moon knew not | what might was his,
            The stars knew not | where their stations were.</p>

<h3>Yggdrasil</h3>
            <p>Yggdrasil is a tree central to the Norse concept of the cosmos. The tree's branches extend into various realms, and various creatures dwell on and around it. The gods go to Yggdrasil daily to assemble at their things, traditional governing assemblies. The branches of Yggdrasil extend far into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend far away into other locations; one to the well Uröarbrunnr in the heavens, one to the spring Hvergelmir, and another to the well Mö­misbrunnr. Creatures live within Yggdrasil, including the dragon Nidhöggr, an unnamed eagle, and the stags Dá¡inn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Duraprór.</p>
